In this repo the following notebooks can be found:

- `sentiment_classifier`: implementation of sentiment classification model (SVM) from scratch in Python.
- `document_classification`: investigation of three models, namely, KNN, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, for document classification


Some commentary was added on the preprocessing, models, hyperparameter search as well as evaluation.
